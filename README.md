# installscripts

note: a lot of these are not 100% complete, though some are.
i threw these together as i was installing various services.
there sort of a combination of scripts and notes, that i 
use as notes and bits of code i can copy and paste into a 
node to do some of the heavy lifting. using these as is 
is not recommended. using these as starter points though 
should work out relatively well. they are a starting point, 
not the end. eventually ill get around to completing them as
i use them and work through some of the problems.
